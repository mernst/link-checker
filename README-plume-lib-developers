Maintenance

Here are some instructions about maintaining this package.

Periodically update the base version of `checklink` from one of these URLs:
  http://search.cpan.org/dist/W3C-LinkChecker/
  https://github.com/w3c/link-checker
To do so, run these commands:
  mv checklink checklink-local
  wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/w3c/link-checker/master/bin/checklink
  chmod ogu+x checklink
  patch -p7 < checklink-upstream.diff
Also perhaps update the diff file in this repository.

Periodically browse to each URL in `checklink-args.txt` and remove any that
are not valid.  Executing the following forms in Emacs, one at a time, will
open sets of URLs in your browser.  It avoids opening all of the URLs in
one go, which might overpower your browser.

  (defun browse-url-checklink (number-prefix)
    (find-file "../bin/checklink-args.txt")
    (goto-char (point-min))
    (browse-url-once-if-matched (concat number-prefix ":\\(http.*\\)") 1))
  (browse-url-checklink "0")
  (browse-url-checklink "1")
  (browse-url-checklink "2")
  (browse-url-checklink "3")
  (browse-url-checklink "4")
  (browse-url-checklink "5")
  (browse-url-checklink "6")
  ;; Just in case the above searches missed something.
  (browse-url-checklink "[^0-6]")
